    # 4) We use the cookie session id as part of the varnish hash subroutine
    # 5) Server response is returned and cached because the session has already been created (Set-Cookie header does not exists).

    # GOAL: We want to cache the content of the page in a separate way, that is 1 cached object by cookie variation, and we want to invalidate this variations with a single request to this page without complex bans expresions
    # 1) If we are using only [hash_data(req.http.cookie)], We are storing 1 object per cookie variation but when we try to purge the page, nothing is purged cause hash_data(req.http.cookie) is creating a unique identifier by variation.
    # 2) If we use [hash_data(req.http.cookie)] plus sending Vary: Cookie, the problem still the same as in the previous point. hash_data(req.http.cookie) creates a unique identifier by variation.
    # 3) If we only use Vary: Cookie in our backend, We are storing 1 object per cookie variation but this time all works as expected because Varnish stores the objects sharing the same hash value so we can purge as a unit.
